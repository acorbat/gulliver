During Gulliver's first part of his trips, he arrives to Lilliput and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people. 
Whole slide imaging looks similar as one is prisoner of an image filled with small details and not too much memory to load everything at the same time.
Additionally, Gulliver can be separated into Gul and Liver, Gul in swedish means yellow and some of the diseases this pipeline was developed for end up in yellow livers.
